# IronArch - The One-Click Arch Linux Installer

## Overview

IronArch amied to be a collection of scripts and installer with provisioning service script. It is currently incomplete; however, the custom_installs do work (last time I ran them one was for a vm to download music becasue I prefered to run linux in a VM on Windows over the sub system. The other was for my Ethereum mining ventures). Eventually this could be a one-click installer for Arch Linux.

## Features

- **One script installation**: Get Arch Linux up and running with just a single script and few edits.
- **Installs an Openbox environment**: great for anyone wanting to use openbox 
- **Fast and Efficient**: Designed for quick deployment, saving you time and effort.
